“Shall 1 Compare Thee T2 3 Summer’s Day?” b4 William Shakespeare
Shall 5 compare thee t6 7 summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds d8 shake the darling buds o9 May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short 1 date.
Sometime too hot the eye 11 heaven shines,
And often 12 his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
13 chance, 14 nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession 15 that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest 16 his shade,
When 17 eternal lines 18 Time thou grow’st.
19 long 20 men can breathe, 21 eyes can see,
22 long lives this, and this gives life 23 thee.
